# ARKHE Branding & Domain Strategy

## Brand Identity

**ARKHE (Ἀρχή)** - Ancient Greek for "origin," "beginning," and "first principle"

### Brand Philosophy

ARKHE embodies the concept of foundational excellence. Just as the ancient Greek philosophers sought the arkhe - the fundamental principle underlying all of reality - modern vibe coders seek the foundation for building exceptional products with AI.

### Visual Identity

#### Logo
- **Symbol**: Sparkles (✨) - representing the spark of creation
- **Typography**: Monospace font with Greek characters
- **Colors**: Dynamic theme system with 6 premium themes

#### Design Language
- **Obsidian Glass**: Premium glassmorphism with depth
- **Prismatic Effects**: Subtle rainbow refractions on hover
- **Shimmer Animations**: Elegant light sweeps across interactive elements
- **Gradient Overlays**: Multi-layered depth with transparency
